## 📐 Page Structure (4 Sections)

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
**Purpose:** Immediate differentiation + clear value proposition

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Wordmark/Logo** (Top-left)
   - "Flow Studio"
   - Clean, technical typography

2. **Hero Headline** (H1)
   - "AI design agents that understand your brand"
   - Supporting line: "Build brand-coherent web experiences with a design system that thinks systematically, not magically."
   - **Messaging:** Systematic, not magical. Brand-aware, not generic.

3. **Value Proposition** (1-2 sentences)
   - "Flow Studio's specialized agents—Arto, Stylist, Builder, Curator, Maestro—read your brand config, apply design tokens consistently, and generate polished UIs that feel intentional, not templated."

4. **Primary CTA**
   - Button: "Start building"
   - Secondary CTA: "Learn how it works"
   - Tertiary micro-copy: "Currently in private beta"

**Layout Notes:**
- Clean, centered layout with max-width 720px for text
- White or very subtle gray background (confident minimalism)
- CTAs: Primary (blue accent), secondary (outline)
- Mobile: Stack vertically, maintain hierarchy

### Section 2: The Problem (Pain Points)
**Purpose:** Establish shared frustration with current AI design tools

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Section Eyebrow** (Small caps, accent color)
   - "Why Flow Studio?"

2. **Section Headline** (H2)
   - "AI tools generate designs. Flow Studio generates design systems."

3. **3-Column Grid (Desktop) / Stacked (Mobile)**
   Each column contains:
   - **Problem Icon** (subtle, line-art)
   - **Pain Point Title** (H3)
   - **Problem Description** (2-3 sentences)

**Content:**

**Column 1: Generic Output**
- **Title:** "Templates, not brands"
- **Copy:** "Most AI design tools generate generic, templated UIs that look obviously AI-made. Every output feels like it came from the same mold, ignoring your brand's unique voice and visual identity."

**Column 2: Manual Polish Required**
- **Title:** "Generate, then fix"
- **Copy:** "You spend more time correcting AI mistakes—adjusting spacing, fixing contrast, aligning to your brand—than you save. The promise of automation becomes a cycle of manual refinement."

**Column 3: No System Memory**
- **Title:** "Inconsistent across projects"
- **Copy:** "AI tools forget. Each generation is isolated, with no memory of your design tokens, brand constraints, or past decisions. Maintaining consistency across projects becomes impossible."

**Layout Notes:**
- Background: Light gray (#f5f5f4) for subtle visual separation
- Icons: Line-art, slate color, 32px
- Typography: Clear hierarchy, readable at all sizes
- Spacing: 24px gap between columns (desktop)

- **Description:** "Stylist translates your brand definition into concrete design tokens—colors, typography, spacing, shadows. Every value is intentional and documented."

**Agent 3: Builder (Implementation)**
- **Role:** Semantic HTML & Components
- **Description:** "Builder creates clean, accessible, token-driven components and pages. Semantic HTML, responsive layouts, no hardcoded values."

**Agent 4: Curator (Evaluator)**

- **Description:** "Curator evaluates brand alignment, accessibility compliance, visual consistency, and token usage. Catches issues before you see them."

**Agent 5: Maestro (Orchestrator)**

- **Description:** "Maestro coordinates the agents, ensures the right brand config is used, and orchestrates iterative refinement based on feedback."

**Layout Notes:**
- Background: White
