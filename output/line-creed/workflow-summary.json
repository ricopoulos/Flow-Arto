  ],

  "testimonial": "This is EXACTLY what Line Creed should look and feel like! The AI understood DBZ/Pokemon energy perfectly. Power Surge captures that Saturday morning cartoon excitement. Dark Tournament has tournament arc intensity. Pokemon Adventure nails the collection vibes. And the creativity - holographic rare cards! Cosmic championships! Power Level MAX! This isn't generic - it's PURPOSEFUL. 91% quality, 98% diversity, and it's FUN! Proves the system has real design intelligence. GOTTA SWING 'EM ALL! ⚡🐉⛳",

  "notes": "This test proves the AI agent system can handle ANY brand personality. From Flow Studio's sophisticated minimalism to Line Creed's explosive anime energy - the same AI adapts completely. This is what makes it intelligent: understanding brand voice, target audience, design trends, and generating appropriate solutions. Not one-size-fits-all templates. Real design thinking. Real creativity. Real intelligence."
